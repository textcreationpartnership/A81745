         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> All the Scriptures which require repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and mortification during this life, do deny the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121325:8"/> of Perfection. For they and it are incompatible. As for the commands they are the meaſure of our duty, not of our ability to obedience. Ther's no reaſon to the contrary, but that Gods commands ſhould run in the old ſtile, though we are unable to fulfil them. As for <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. which he quotes, 'tis plain that that reſurrect, with Chriſt, was conſiſtent with ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are upon the earth;</hi> By <hi>members</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand inordinate deſires, motions and actions of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature (ſuch as are reckoned up in the verſe) By <hi>mortifying</hi> them, a c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Argument to inforce the duty of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is drawn (as from their death with Chriſt, and life with him,) ſo from their firſt and ſpiritual reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. But the ſtate of the reſurrection which <hi>Paul</hi> denies, is of that perfection of holineſſe (as I told you <hi>G.W.</hi>) which accompanies the laſt and bodily reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18 22. I anſwered it in my Book, <hi>p.</hi> 47. The Apoſtle explains himſelf, that he means <hi>from the dominion of ſin, v</hi> 14.

Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> being the laſt that preached, it ſo fell out, that when he was in his laſt Prayer, there were two Quakers made a very great diſturbance in the publick aſſembly, in the very preſence of authority: This will be teſtified by many Witneſſes that were preſent. And they ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their own Worſhip as little as they do ours. For <hi>March</hi> 6 1659, one <hi>Mary Todd</hi> of <hi>Southwark,</hi> Quaker, at the Bull and Mouth in Alderſgate-ſtreet, an uſual Meeting place, whilſt her Friends (as they call one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) were ſpeaking, pull'd up all her cloaths above her middle,<note place="margin">Mr. Tho.

And whereas 'tis an uſual thing for the Quakers to call Miniſters of the Goſpel Liars, it is well enough known, that beſides the Lies of their Doctrine, they have not ſo much moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, as to ſpeak Truth in matters of Fact.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> laſt, there having been ſome diſcourſe one day between one <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi> Quaker,<note place="margin">Mr. Ruſſel, Min. in the Marſh.</note> and a Miniſter in <hi>Rumney</hi> Marſh, the next day was appointed for further diſcourſe between them two, but over-night the ſaid <hi>Howard</hi> ſent his horſe and man for Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> (ſometime a Miniſter, now a Quaker, and ſuſpected to be a Jeſuit.) and going with him to the place of meeting, told the people, that ſeeing <hi>S. Fiſher</hi> came accidentally thither, he would now leave the diſcourſe to him; whereupon one among the people ſtept out, and told <hi>Howard</hi> that he lied, for he did ſee his horſe and man go out over-night, and ſee the ſaid <hi>Fiſher</hi> ride into the Town on the morning upon the ſame horſe, by which it was manifeſt that he ſent for him on purpoſe. All that they could ſay in juſtification of themſelves, was, that the ſaid <hi>Fiſher</hi> came accidentally in reſpect of the people or Miniſter who was to diſcourſe, they knowing nothing of his coming. To conclude, I deſire thee Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to peruſe the Quakers anſwer to certain queſtions propoſed to them, hereto annexed, wherein thou wilt find them <hi>denying the Scriptures to be the Rule for judging matters of Faith; aſserting that they ſhould have had knowledge of God ſufficient to ſalvation, if they had never heard of the Bible; and their words and writings are as infallible as the Scriptures; and again, denying the Perſons in the Godhead, the Humane, Nature of Chriſt, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121325:20"/> Chriſt is a diſtinct Perſon from the Saints, and that there hath been a true Church ſince the Apoſtles, till now, and that one day is more holy than another.</hi> And ſurely by theſe Principles in conjunction with the reſt which thou haſt an account of in the Book it ſelf, to which this Narrative is annexed, the Quakers have for ever forfeited the name of Chriſtians, and are to be reputed Heathens.</p>

            <p>Anſ. I do believe if I had never ſeen the Bible, yet believing the Witneſſe which God hath given, which is Chriſt, the Light &amp; hope and Glory in us, which we ſo much ſpeak of, and preach freely as we have received, to the offending of thoſe deceivers that preach for hire, and ſo make merchandiſe of the people, I ſay, I ſhould have attained to the knowledge of God, if I had never heard of the Bible.</p>
